This repository contains a comprehensive and fictional penal code designed specifically for FiveM roleplay servers. The SACP provides a detailed list of offenses, fines, and jail times to enhance realism and provide a framework for law enforcement roleplay within the FiveM environment.

## Features

*   **Detailed Offenses:**  Covers a wide range of criminal activities, from traffic violations to serious felonies, including offenses against persons, property, public order, and those related to drugs, weapons, and organized crime.
*   **Realistic Fines:**  Includes fines in in-game currency to provide economic consequences for criminal actions and encouraging lawful behavior.
*   **Jail Time in Seconds:**  Uses a jail time system measured in seconds, allowing for flexible and balanced punishments within the FiveM server environment.
*   **Clear Descriptions:**  Provides clear and concise descriptions of each offense to help law enforcement officers (players) determine the appropriate charges for different scenarios.
*   **Roleplay Focus:**  Designed with a focus on enhancing roleplay depth and immersion, encouraging realistic interactions between law enforcement and civilians.

## Penal Code Structure

The SACP is organized into categories for easy reference:

*   Offenses Against Persons (e.g., murder, assault, kidnapping)
*   Offenses Against Property (e.g., robbery, burglary, vandalism)
*   Vehicle Code Violations (e.g., reckless driving, DUI, speeding)
